# Tweek - 2016 Angular 2 Hackathon

## Description
Tweek is a online single player game that integrates with the twitch API. The main game consists of a screenshot from a live twitch screen covered by 4 squares. The squares start to disappear one at a time. The goal is to guess the game being played from the list of options. The sooner you guess the more points you get. Wrong answers lock you out for a set time. 

## Status
Moving this code over from the github repo that was used during the hackathon. Haven't run it since, so it may not work correctly
